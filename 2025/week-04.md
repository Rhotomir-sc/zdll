# 📅 Week 4: Making Decisions

**Date Range:** October 20 - October 26, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Recap
My code can make decisions now using `if-else`. In Linux, we covered Permissions, which was a bit confusing at first.

### 🛠️ What I Learned
1.  **Linux:** Permissions (`chmod`).
    * `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute).
    * `ls -l` shows a weird string like `drwxr-xr-x`. I'm starting to understand what it means.
2.  **C++:** Logic gates (`&&`, `||`). If this AND that happens, do this.
3.  **Networks:** IP Addresses. Class A, B, C. Lots of numbers to remember.

### ⚠️ Struggles
I accidentally locked myself out of a file by messing up permissions. Had to use `sudo` to fix it.
