# 📅 Week 8: While Loops & Updates

**Date Range:** November 17 - November 23, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Recap
Exams are done. Back to coding. Learned about `while` loops and how to update Linux.

### 🛠️ What I Learned
1.  **C++:** `while` loops. Almost crashed my PC with an infinite loop.
2.  **Linux:** Package managers (`apt`).
    * `apt update` vs `apt upgrade`. Basically checking for updates vs actually installing them.
3.  **Cyber Security:** Malware types. Ransomware sounds terrifying.
