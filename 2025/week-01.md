# Week 01
# 📅 Week 1: First Step into University & Cyber World

**Date Range:** September 29 - October 5, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Summary
Since it was the first week of university, we focused on course introductions and setting up our environment. The **Introduction to Cyber Security** and **Programming** courses specifically shaped my vision for the future.

### 📚 Course Notes & Labs
#### 1. DDO 105 - Programming I (C++)
* **Topic:** What is an algorithm? How to draw Flowcharts.
* **Practice:** We drew flowcharts for daily tasks (like brewing tea) and basic mathematical operations.
* **Note:** A developer must establish the logic in their mind before writing any code.

#### 2. BGT 104 - Introduction to Cyber Security
* **Topic:** What is Cyber Security? Hacker types (White/Grey/Black Hat).
* **Concept:** I learned about the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Security is built on this foundation.

#### 3. BGT 103 - Operating Systems (Linux/Windows)
* **Topic:** Operating System architecture. The concept of Virtualization.
* **Lab:** I installed **VirtualBox** on my computer and tried creating a virtual machine.

#### 4. BGT 102 - Computer Networks
* **Topic:** How the Internet works. Differences between LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network).

### 💻 First Code Attempt (Pseudo-Code)
We haven't written actual code yet, but the logic was:
```text
START
  READ Number1
  READ Number2
  Sum = Number1 + Number2
  PRINT Sum
END
