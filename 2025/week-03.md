# 📅 Week 3: Input/Output & Files

**Date Range:** October 13 - October 19, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Recap
Learned how to make the code interact with me (Input). Also played around with creating and deleting files in Linux.

### 🛠️ Key Learnings
1.  **Linux:** File management.
    * `mkdir` to make folders, `touch` for files. The `rm` command is scary – gotta be careful not to delete everything.
2.  **C++:** Using `cin`. It's cool to see the program ask for a number and then use it.
3.  **Cyber Security:** Social Engineering. It's crazy how easy it is to trick people. The human element is definitely the weakest link.

### 💻 My Code
Simple interaction:
```cpp
int number;
cout << "Give me a number: ";
cin >> number;
// Now the code does something with it.
