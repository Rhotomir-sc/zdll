# 📅 Week 9: Bash Scripting

**Date Range:** November 24 - November 30, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Recap
Started automating stuff in Linux using Bash. It's like coding, but directly for the system.

### 🛠️ What I Did
1.  **Linux:** Wrote my first `.sh` script.
    * Using `echo` and variables in the terminal.
2.  **C++:** Nested Loops. Made a multiplication table. Logic is getting complex.
3.  **Networks:** DNS and DHCP. How my phone gets an IP automatically.

### 💻 Bash Code
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World from Terminal"
