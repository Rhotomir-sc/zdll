# Week 02
# 📅 Week 2: Terminal & Variables

**Date Range:** October 6 - October 12, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Recap
Finally opened the Linux terminal. Felt a bit like a hacker typing commands instead of clicking icons. Also started variables in C++.

### 🛠️ What I Did
1.  **Linux:** Ditched the GUI for the CLI (Command Line).
    * Used `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd` all day. `clear` is my favorite command so far.
2.  **C++:** Learned about data types. `int` for numbers, `string` for text. Simple stuff.
3.  **Networks:** OSI Model. 7 layers to memorize... started with the Physical Layer (cables).

### 💻 Code Snippet
```cpp
int age = 19;
char grade = 'A';
// Just testing how to store data in memory.
