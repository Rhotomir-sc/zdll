# 📅 Week 1: University Kickoff

**Date Range:** September 29 - October 5, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Recap
First week of uni. Mostly orientation and setting up accounts, but things are getting real. The Introduction to Cyber Security class got me pretty excited about the field.

### 📚 Class Notes
#### 1. Programming I (C++)
* **Algorithms:** We talked about what an algorithm actually is.
* **Practice:** Drew flowcharts for making tea. Sounds funny, but it helps to visualize the logic before coding.

#### 2. Intro to Cyber Security
* **Concept:** Learned about White/Grey/Black Hat hackers.
* **Key Takeaway:** The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). It's basically the holy grail of security.

#### 3. Operating Systems
* **Lab:** Installed **VirtualBox**. Trying to set up a virtual machine was a bit tricky but I managed to do it.

#### 4. Computer Networks
* **Topic:** LAN vs WAN. Just the basics of how the internet connects.

### 💻 First Steps
No real code yet, just logic:
