# 📅 Week 6: Loops

**Date Range:** November 3 - November 9, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Recap
Loops are a game changer. I can make the computer do repetitive tasks instantly.

### 🛠️ Key Learnings
1.  **C++:** The `for` loop. Printed numbers 1-100 in a milisecond.
2.  **Linux:** Processes.
    * `top` shows what's eating the CPU. `kill` is useful when a program crashes.
3.  **Networks:** TCP vs UDP. TCP checks if data arrived, UDP just throws it. Good to know for gaming lag.

### 💻 Code Snippet
```cpp
for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
    cout << "Looping " << i << endl;
}
