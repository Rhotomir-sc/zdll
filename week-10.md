# 📅 Week 10: Arrays & Setting up GitHub

**Date Range:** December 1 - December 7, 2025

## 🎯 Weekly Recap
Professionalized this GitHub profile and learned Arrays in C++.

### 🛠️ What I Learned
1.  **C++:** Arrays. Instead of creating `int a, b, c`, I can just use `int list[3]`. Way better.
2.  **Linux:** Advanced Bash. Wrote a script to update my Kali system automatically.
3.  **GitHub:** Finally set up this **ZDLL** repo properly. Configured Git `user.name` and learned how to push without errors.

### 🚀 Project
Uploaded my `update_kali.sh` script to the repo. Check the 2025 folder.
